# An Analysis of Weather for Oahu
## Analyzing weather summary of Oahu for the Summer and Winter months.\
We took a look at average temperatures in Oahu for the months of June and December to find trends during the start of summer and the start of winter. Using these two months, which are six months apart, gave us good insight into temperature trends without being flooded with unnecessary data.

## Results of the Oahu Temperature Analysis
- For the month of June, we showed a maximum temperature of 85 degrees and a minimum temperature of 64 degrees
- For the month of December, the maximum temperature was 83 while the minimum dropped down to 56.
- The mean, or average, for June was 74 and was 71 for December

# Temperature Trends
While the minimum temperature for Oahu dropped to 56 degrees in December, the average temperature stayed close to the average temperature we saw in June. Oahu appears to show a stable temperature in both June and December so we could expect the same results year round.

## Finally Summary of Oahu Analysis
Checking temperature trends for June and December gave us a good idea of what to expect for the weather in Oahu through the year. However, if we wanted to do a more thorough look into the data, we could also check the months of September and March (the beginning of autumn and spring). When looking at the data for June and December, we could look at precipitation data to see how many cloudy or rainy days we could expect during those months. We could also look into the temperatures on a day by day basis to see if the colder days happen all in a row, with a cold front, or happen sporadically here and there throughout the month.

Overall, I believe the warm and stable temperatures make Oahu a perfect location to open a Surf and Ice Cream shop!
